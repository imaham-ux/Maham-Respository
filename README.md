Kursi Object Identifier is a web-based tool that classifies plastic objects into categories — Black, Transparent, or Colorful — by analyzing their image’s average color and brightness. It assigns each type to a specific conveyor belt for sorting, simulating an automated recycling system. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Canvas API), it offers a simple, client-side image processing demo for waste management concepts

 How It Works:
 1.Image Upload: Users upload an image of a plastic object.
 2.Image Analysis: The system calculates the average RGB values and brightness using the Canvas API.
3.Classification:
 Black Plastic: Assigned to Conveyor Belt A
 Transparent Plastic: Assigned to Conveyor Belt B
Colorful Plastic: Assigned to Conveyor Belt C
4.Result Display: The analysis results, including average color values and assigned conveyor belt, are displayed to the user.
